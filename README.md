# Virtual-Smart-Home
This project is a virtual smart home simulation system developed using the AVR ATmega32 microcontroller and programmed in Embedded C. The system simulates an interactive smart home interface with both onsite and remote control capabilities.
The main goal of the project is to design a modular, real-time embedded system that controls common household functions using peripheral interfaces and self-written driver code.
Features:
AVR ATmega32 Microcontroller – Main control unit
UART Bluetooth Module – Enables remote control via a mobile app or terminal
Keypad Input – Allows secure password-protected access and menu navigation
LCD Display (16x2) – Provides real-time status and user interface feedback
Smart Devices Controlled:
Door Motor System
Lighting System
Air Conditioning System
Fire Detection and Alarm System
Modular Driver Architecture – All hardware modules are controlled using drivers written from scratch (no external libraries)
